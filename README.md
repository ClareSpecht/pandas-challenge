Georgia Tech Data Analytics Boot Camp HW #4:
In this homework, I used the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook to analyze school district data to help a school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

Through the data, it is clear that more money ought to be dedicated to the math curriculum and resources as the percentage of students passing math is much lower than the percentage passing reading and the average scores are slightly lower as well. In addition, district schools need much more support as their overall passing rate is approximately 37% lower than charter schools. District schools with over 2000 students are the worst off. Despite these conclusions, the percentage of students passing decreases where the spending ranges per student increases. As such, it may be more worthwhile to reevaluate the methods of teaching as opposed to simply throwing more money at areas of failure.
